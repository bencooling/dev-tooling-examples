# react examples

The source code for each example is assumed to be written in es6 (with babel transpiling to es5) unless the example name is prefixed with `es5-`.

Examples work with the following libraries:  
- webpack
- webpack-dev-server
- static-site-generator-webpack-plugin
- react
- react-router
- redux
- falcor
- eslint
- babel
